PRELIMINARY RESULTS, CAPM:
-All assets reject H0: all coefficients time-invariant. (Money close to failing: p = 0.04)
-9/12 industries reject H0: (all coefficients time-varying and) phi = 0 for all t. Chemicals, energy and health fail to reject.
-4 (almost 5) industries show phi significantly > 0 during the approximately 2000 - 2002 period: Energy, telecommunications, utilities, shops, (manufacturing)
	There doesn't appear to be a strong cyclical/defensive relationship here (since energy, telecom (?), utilities are defensive and others are cyclical)
	Phi appears most significantly different from zero in telecom and shops
	(Interesting that energy shows significant positive phi but fails to reject H0 in the test for phi = 0 over all t. This doesn't look great.)
	*To do: look at what returns actually DID during this time period: e.g. we'd expect telecom to be having negative returns
-4 industries show phi significantly < 0 during the approximately 2000 - 2004 period: business equipment, chemicals, consumer durables, consumer nondurables
	This would be a harder returns generating process to bet on/against, since it implies lots of volatility
	*To do: look at what returns actually DID during this time period; i.e. did they appear more choppy than for the assets above?
*Also to-do: keep some track of the optimal bandwidths for each asset

Next steps: robustness checks in FF3, FF5
-Do the above results hold under a different returns generating process? To what extent?
	*Useful things to consider: 
	--graphs which overlay the point estimates/CIs for phi in different specifications: do these look relatively consistent? --> would suggest robustness to returns specification
	--compare results of specification tests: same suggests robustness to returns specification
